# Adaptive-Interviewer
An AI-powered adaptive interview system that adjusts tone, difficulty, and questions based on the candidate’s emotional responses, promoting a more human-centered hiring experience.
This project was built using Base44.com – an AI-powered website generator.
The platform helps make interviews more adaptive and inclusive by responding to
candidate emotions and behavior in real time.
